This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)
```

string1 <- "This is a string"

```{r}
c("one", "two", "three")

```

str_length() tells you the number of characters in a string:

```{r}
str_length(c("a", "R for data science", NA))
```

 If you want missing values to print as "NA", use str_replace_na()
 
 You can count forward and backward to isolate certain characters:
 
```{r}
x <- c("Apple", "Banana", "Pear")
str_sub(x, 1, 3)
"
# negative numbers count backwards from end
str_sub(x, -3, -1)

```
 
 The locale is specified as a ISO 639 language code, which is a two or three letter abbreviation.
 
 
 Exercises:
 
```{r}

paste("x", "y")

paste0("x", "y")
```
 
Paste separates with a space, paste0 does not.

```{r}
x <- c("a", "abc", "abcd", "abcde", "abcdef")
l <- str_length(x)
n <- (l / 2)
str_sub(x, n, n)
```
If it is even number then the choice of the middle number could be one of two.

```{r}
str_trim(" xyz ")
str_trim(" xyz ", side = "right")
```

Regexps are a very terse language that allow you to describe patterns in strings.

str_view() and str_view_all() functions take a character vector and a regular expression, and show you how they match. 

By default, regular expressions will match any part of a string. It’s often useful to anchor the regular expression so that it matches from the start or end of the string. You can use:

^ to match the start of the string.
$ to match the end of the string.

Exercises:

```{r}
str_view(stringr::words, "^y", match = TRUE)
str_view(stringr::words, "x$", match = TRUE)
str_subset(stringr::words, "^[aeiou]")
str_subset(stringr::words, "^[ed$]")
```

There are a number of special patterns that match more than one character. There are four other useful tools:

\d: matches any digit.
\s: matches any whitespace (e.g. space, tab, newline).
[abc]: matches a, b, or c.
[^abc]: matches anything except a, b, or c.

```{r}
str_view(c("abc", "a.c", "a*c", "a c"), "a[.]c")
```
The next step up in power involves controlling how many times a pattern matches:

?: 0 or 1
+: 1 or more
*: 0 or more

A capturing group stores the part of the string matched by the part of the regular expression inside the parentheses.

```{r}
str_view(fruit, "(..)\\1", match = TRUE)
```
stringr functions that let you:

Determine which strings match a pattern.
Find the positions of matches.
Extract the content of matches.
Replace matches with new values.
Split a string based on a match.

 If you get stuck trying to create a single regexp that solves your problem, take a step back and think if you could break the problem down into smaller pieces, solving each challenge before moving onto the next one.
 
 To determine if a character vector matches a pattern, use str_detect(). It returns a logical vector the same length as the input:
 
```{r}
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_detect(x, "e")
```
 
**when you use a logical vector in a numeric context, FALSE becomes 0 and TRUE becomes 1**

For example, here are two ways to find all words that don’t contain any vowels:

```{r}
no_vowels_1 <- !str_detect(words, "[aeiou]")

no_vowels_2 <- str_detect(words, "^[^aeiou]+$")
identical(no_vowels_1, no_vowels_2)
```

If your regular expression gets overly complicated, try breaking it up into smaller pieces, giving each piece a name, and then combining the pieces with logical operations.

A variation on str_detect() is str_count(): rather than a simple yes or no, it tells you how many matches there are in a string.

```{r}
words[str_detect(words, "^x|x$")]
```

```{r}

startwithx <- str_detect(words, "^x")
endwithx <- str_detect(words, "x$")
words[startwithx | endwithx]
```

```{r}
vowels = str_count(words, "[aeiou]")
words[which(vowels == max(vowels))]
```

To extract the actual text of a match, use str_extract(). 
Example used by author:
```{r}
colours <- c("red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "purple")
colour_match <- str_c(colours, collapse = "|")
colour_match
has_colour <- str_subset(sentences, colour_match)
matches <- str_extract(has_colour, colour_match)
head(matches)
more <- sentences[str_count(sentences, colour_match) > 1]
str_view_all(more, colour_match) #extracts actual text
```
str_extract() gives us the complete match; str_match() gives each individual component.Instead of a character vector, it returns a matrix, with one column for the complete match followed by one column for each group.

str_replace() and str_replace_all() allow you to replace matches with new strings. 

With str_replace_all() you can perform multiple replacements by supplying a named vector:
```{r}
x <- c("1 house", "2 cars", "3 people")
str_replace_all(x, c("1" = "one", "2" = "two", "3" = "three"))
```

Use str_split() to split a string up into pieces. 
```{r}
sentences %>%
  head(5) %>% 
  str_split(" ")
```

str_locate() and str_locate_all() give you the starting and ending positions of each match.

**stringi** is a good learning tool if stringr is giving problems. stringi is more minimal and can be good for getting the hang of the basics.

Factors

categorical variables: variables that have a fixed and known set of possible values. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(forcats)
```

To create a factor you must start by creating a list of the valid levels:

```{r}
x1 <- c("Dec", "Apr", "Jan", "Mar")
month_levels <- c(
  "Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", 
  "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec")
```

```{r}
y1 <- factor(x1, levels = month_levels)
y1
sort(y1)
```

```{r}
x2 <- c("Dec", "Apr", "Jam", "Mar")
y2 <- factor(x2, levels = month_levels)
y2
```

NA shows for misspelled data entry 
```{r}
gss_cat
```
